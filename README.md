# Arma Reforger Terminator
A simple AutoIt v3 utility that terminates Arma Reforger while saving your slot on the current server.

Useful for the following scenarios:
* You live in a country with inconsistent power supply, and use a UPS.
* You want to stack a certain team with all your friends, but there's no room on the team. (less ethical)

## How to get the utlity
If you don't trust random .exe's found on the internet, follow these steps:

* Take a look at the [script](https://github.com/ExpendaBubble/TerminateArmaReforger/blob/main/TerminateArmaReforger.au3) and make sure there's no funny business.
* Clone or [download](https://github.com/ExpendaBubble/TerminateArmaReforger/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract this repository.
* Download and install [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/).
* Run **Compiile Script to .exe**.
* Click the first Browse button to select the .au3 file.
* Click the second Browse button to select where you want to save the compiled .exe file.
* click the third Browse button to select the .ico file. You can also use your own icon, or not use one at all. I prefer unicorns.
* Click the Convert button.

If you want to roll the dice, download the [pre-compiled release](https://github.com/ExpendaBubble/TerminateArmaReforger/releases/download/v1.0.0/Arma.Reforger.Terminator.exe).

## How to use the utility
Simply double-click the **Arma Reforger Terminator.exe** file. Your anti-virus will bitch and moan whether you compiled it yourself or not. Such is life.
